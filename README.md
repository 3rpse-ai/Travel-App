# Travel App Project

## Overview
This is my contribution to the capstone project of Udacity's Frontend Web Dev Nanodegree Program

## Explanantion
I use the server.js for all 3rd party API calls. Why? Because I would like to avoid to expose my api keys in URLs sent via the Client. 

## Extras
I have implemented two of the extras: Deleting and Adding Addtional Trips. Also I have added an autosuggest box.
